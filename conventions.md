# Conventions

## OWL Format

All documents in this repo use OWL (Operational Working Language) format:

- Clear, concise, actionable
- Section headers with `##`
- Code examples where relevant
- No fluff — every line should be useful to an agent reading it

## Naming

- Filenames: lowercase, hyphens for spaces (e.g., `auth-tiers.md`)
- Directories: lowercase, no spaces
- Session notes: `sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/<topic>.md`

## Commits

- One topic per commit
- Descriptive commit messages
- Tag OWL specs with version if they evolve
